//! ADR-2010 — durable governance outcome receipts.
//!
//! A signed governance response used to disappear into a gap. `handle_event`
//! sent `OK` and broadcast the moment `save_event` returned, then projected the
//! decision into the case tables as a separate, unchecked step: a `broker_decisions`
//! `INSERT` followed by a `broker_cases` `UPDATE`, each with its result discarded.
//! Three failure shapes followed from that:
//!
//! 1. **A relay `OK` that means nothing downstream.** The client shows
//!    "Response sent" on an acknowledgement that certifies only that the
//!    envelope was stored — not that the decision took effect.
//! 2. **Half-applied projections.** The decision row could land while the case
//!    state update did not, leaving a case whose recorded decision and
//!    displayed state disagree, with nothing recording that it happened.
//! 3. **No replay identity.** A re-delivered event re-ran the whole projection.
//!
//! This module supplies the missing spine: a durable, per-event receipt that
//! records which **stage** a response actually reached, correlated to every
//! identifier a downstream consumer needs to verify authority independently.
//!
//! ## Stages
//!
//! `signed → relay-accepted → projection-committed`, with `projection-failed`
//! as the terminal error state. Each stage certifies **only itself**: a receipt
//! at `relay-accepted` says the relay durably holds the signed envelope and
//! nothing more. A timeout or an interrupted delivery leaves the receipt where
//! it was, so a pending response is visibly pending rather than implicitly
//! approved. Nothing in this module ever reports success for a mutation that
//! did not commit.
//!
//! ## Atomicity
//!
//! D1 cannot span the event-envelope write and the projection in one
//! transaction — `save_event` has already committed by the time a projection is
//! planned. ADR-2010 anticipates exactly this and permits the alternative:
//! *"retain a durable replay record with idempotent reconciliation"*. The
//! receipt row written at `relay-accepted` **is** that record. The projection
//! itself is then genuinely atomic: the decision `INSERT`, the case `UPDATE` and
//! the receipt's stage transition are submitted as a single D1 `batch`, which
//! Cloudflare executes in one implicit transaction. The half-applied projection
//! is therefore not merely unlikely, it is unrepresentable.
//!
//! ## Idempotency
//!
//! The receipt is keyed by the full 64-hex signed event id. A replayed event
//! finds its receipt already present:
//!
//! - already `projection-committed` → the replay is counted and **no mutation
//!   is re-run**;
//! - still `relay-accepted`, or `projection-failed` → the replay is a
//!   *reconciliation* opportunity and the projection is retried. That retry is
//!   safe because the decision insert is `INSERT OR IGNORE` on a deterministic
//!   decision id derived from the event id, and the case update is a state
//!   assignment rather than an increment.
//!
//! Retrying the same signed event can therefore never duplicate the mutation.
