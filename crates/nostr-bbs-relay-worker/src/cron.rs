//! Sprint v11 — One-shot profiles backfill.
//!
//! Replays every stored kind-0 NIP-01 metadata event through the same UPSERT
//! logic the live ingest hook uses, populating the `profiles` projection table
//! for any pubkey whose kind-0 was stored before the projection landed (Sprint
//! v10) or any row that was lost between schema migrations.
//!
//! ## Idempotency
//!
//! The UPSERT carries a `WHERE excluded.last_kind0_at >= profiles.last_kind0_at`
//! guard, so re-running the backfill never overwrites a fresher row. A
//! malformed kind-0 (`content` is not JSON, or not an object) is skipped
//! silently — a single bad event must never abort the batch.
//!
//! ## Streaming
//!
//! D1 has a per-statement row ceiling and a worker CPU budget. We page through
//! the `events` table in batches of [`BACKFILL_BATCH_SIZE`] ordered by
//! `created_at DESC` so the freshest profile per pubkey is upserted first; the
//! `last_kind0_at` guard then filters out older copies that follow.
//!
//! ## Auth
//!
//! Triggered manually via `POST /api/admin/profiles/backfill` (NIP-98 admin
//! authed). We deliberately do NOT wire this into the existing 5-minute cron
//! trigger — backfill is a one-shot operation, and the live ingest hook keeps
//! the projection current after that.
