//! ADR-2006 — inactivity-decay trust demotion sweep.
//!
//! Demotion is **time-driven**: its precondition is ~6 months of inactivity, so
//! it runs on the scheduled (cron) trigger and never on the admission hot path,
//! where it would be evaluated against active users — the opposite of its gate.
//!
//! This module owns the *mechanics* of the sweep. The *policy* lives in
//! [`crate::trust::decide_demotion`], which is pure and shared with the
//! per-pubkey [`crate::trust::check_demotion`] path so the two cannot drift.
//!
//! ## Why keyset pagination, not `OFFSET`
//!
//! The sweep mutates the very column its candidate predicate filters on
//! (`trust_level`). With `LIMIT/OFFSET`, every row demoted out of the eligible
//! band (TL1 → TL0) shrinks the result set *underneath* the offset, so the next
//! page starts past rows that have shuffled down into the window. Concretely:
//! 400 eligible rows at a batch size of 200, all of page one demoted to TL0 —
//! the second query asks for `OFFSET 200` over a set that now holds only the
//! 200 untouched rows, gets an empty page, and the sweep stops having processed
//! half the work while reporting clean completion.
//!
//! A **keyset cursor** over `(last_active_at, pubkey)` is immune to this:
//! neither column is written by a demotion, so the ordering key of every row is
//! stable across the mutation boundary. The next page is "everything ordered
//! after the last row I actually consumed", which is well defined whether or not
//! the rows behind it left the eligible set. The `pubkey` tiebreak makes the
//! order total, so a cohort sharing one `last_active_at` — the common case when
//! rows are seeded or migrated in bulk — still pages deterministically instead
//! of looping on the same tie or skipping past it.
//!
//! ## Why outcomes are explicit
//!
//! The previous implementation discarded the result of both the `UPDATE` and
//! the audit `INSERT` (`let _ = …`) and then returned the *planned* level. A
//! failed write was therefore indistinguishable from a committed one, and the
//! sweep's `demoted` count included demotions that never happened. Here every
//! row resolves to exactly one [`RowOutcome`], the counters move only on a
//! confirmed commit, and failures are both counted and sampled for the operator.
//!
//! ## Why the commit is a batch
//!
//! The trust-level `UPDATE` and the `admin_log` audit `INSERT` describe the same
//! fact. Issued separately they can diverge: a level change with no audit trail,
//! or an audit entry for a change that did not land. They are submitted as one
//! D1 `batch`, which Cloudflare executes inside a single implicit transaction,
//! so audit and state commit together or not at all.
