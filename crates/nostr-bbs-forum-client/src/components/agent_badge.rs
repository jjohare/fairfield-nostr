//! Agent disclosure badge (COM-13/F2, ADR-106 Decision 3).
//!
//! Fetches the active agent set from the relay's public
//! `GET /api/agents/disclosure` endpoint and caches it in a Leptos context.
//! [`AgentBadge`] reads that cache reactively and, when a rendered author
//! pubkey belongs to an active agent, shows a visually distinct AGENT pill
//! naming the authorising principal (`registered_by`).
//!
//! Trust root: the authorising principal is always sourced from the server-side
//! registry, never from event content. A self-declared "I am an agent" tag
//! carries no badge; a registry-active agent always carries one. This mirrors
//! the relay's own registered-agent write gate, keeping disclosure honest.
//!
//! The cache is provided once at the app root, so the active set is fetched
//! once for the whole page rather than per badge.
//!
//! ## Freshness and failure are part of the disclosure
//!
//! The registry is a live, mutable record: a key can be registered, revoked, or
//! re-registered under a different principal at any time. A client that fetches
//! it once and fails silently therefore tells the reader something false. The
//! previous implementation did exactly that — a failed fetch logged a warning
//! and left the map empty, and an empty map renders no badge, which is the same
//! thing the UI shows for "this author is a human". A reader could not tell
//! "not an agent" from "we could not find out".
//!
//! So the cache carries an explicit [`DisclosureStatus`] — `Loading`, `Loaded`
//! with the timestamp it was fetched, or `Error` — and the badge derives a
//! [`BadgeState`] from it that distinguishes:
//!
//! - **loading** — no answer yet, agent status unknown (muted marker);
//! - **loaded and fresh** — the registry is authoritative; no badge means human;
//! - **agent** — an AGENT pill naming the authorising principal, carrying the
//!   as-of time in its tooltip and marked when the snapshot is stale;
//! - **stale / error** — the snapshot is past its freshness window or could not
//!   be read at all, so agent status is UNKNOWN and says so.
//!
//! Freshness is bounded ([`DISCLOSURE_TTL_SECS`]) and the cache refreshes
//! itself on an interval, backing off to a shorter retry after a failure, so an
//! already-open tab recovers from a transient outage and picks up registration
//! changes without being reloaded.
//!
//! Trust root: the authorising principal is always sourced from the server-side
//! registry, never from event content.
