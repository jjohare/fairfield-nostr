//! `InfoTerm` — an inline "what does this mean?" explainer for hard terms.
//!
//! The onboarding surfaces lead with plain-English benefits (private, secure,
//! on your device, you're in control) and keep protocol jargon out of the
//! primary reading path. But some technical labels still appear in the
//! *advanced* / *good-to-know* corners (e.g. "relay", "WebID", "encrypted").
//! Rather than delete those terms, `InfoTerm` wraps them so a curious user can
//! get a one-line, jargon-free explanation on hover, focus, or long-press —
//! without us shipping a heavyweight popover system.
//!
//! Mechanics (self-contained, no JS, no popover coordinator):
//!
//! * the visible term is rendered as a dotted-underline `<span>`;
//! * a Tailwind `group`/`group-hover` + `focus-within` bubble is the single
//!   visible tooltip for pointer and keyboard users — we deliberately do *not*
//!   also set a native `title=` on that element, since the browser would paint
//!   its own tooltip on top of the styled bubble, producing two overlapping
//!   tooltips on hover;
//! * the bubble carries a "Learn more →" link to the full glossary entry for
//!   the term (issue #19), so a curious user can read a longer plain-English
//!   explanation. The bubble itself stays `pointer-events-none` (so it never
//!   eats clicks meant for the page behind it) and only the link re-enables
//!   `pointer-events`, so it is clickable while hovered/focused;
//! * accessibility is carried instead by `aria-label` (the term + explainer)
//!   plus `aria-describedby` pointing at the bubble, so screen readers still
//!   announce the explanation without a competing native tooltip;
//! * `tabindex="0"` + `role="note"` make it keyboard- and AT-focusable.
//!
//! It is brand-neutral by construction: it only renders the `term` and
//! `explainer` strings the caller passes, so deploy-time branding is untouched.
//! The glossary link respects `FORUM_BASE` via [`crate::app::base_href`].

/// * `term` — the word as shown in the UI (e.g. `"relay"`).
/// * `explainer` — a one-line, plain-English description shown on
///   hover/focus/long-press (e.g. `"The server that stores and relays the

/// * `slug` — optional glossary anchor for the "Learn more →" link. When set
///   (e.g. `"relay"`) the link targets `/glossary#relay`; when omitted it links
///   to the top of the glossary. Slugs are defined in
