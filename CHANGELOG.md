# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is loosely based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project tracks its architecture decisions in [`docs/adr/`](docs/adr/).

## [Unreleased]

## [1.0.0-beta.10] — 2026-09-06

Governance-receipts and identity release; every kit crate moves to
`1.0.0-beta.10`. The relay gains a durable receipt for every governance
event it accepts, the client gains bootstrap, freshness and reconcile paths,
and identity subkeys carry published test vectors. Registry crates
superseded by this release are yanked once the DreamLab deployment pins it.

### Added

- **Governance receipts (relay-worker).** Every accepted kind-3140x event is
  recorded in a new `governance_receipts` D1 table (`migrations/0005`) with
  its stage, projection outcome and replay count; the schema is applied
  idempotently by the worker at startup, so no manual `d1 migrations apply`
  is needed. Receipts migrate existing decisions forward (`486ec5a`).
- **Feature gate (core).** Operators enable forum features per deployment
  through a typed gate rather than ad-hoc config reads (`486ec5a`).
- **Identity subkey vectors (core).** Published derivation vectors for
  `derive_subkey`, pinned in `tests/identity_subkey_vectors.rs` (`486ec5a`).
- **Client bootstrap, freshness and reconcile (forum-client).** The client
  bootstraps from the relay's disclosure endpoint, tracks freshness per
  channel and reconciles local read positions against the relay (`486ec5a`).
- **Trust sweep (relay-worker).** A periodic sweep retires stale trust rows
  (`486ec5a`).
- **Indexed tag lookups (relay-worker).** A trigger-maintained `event_tags`
  table replaces JSON scans, the D1 free-tier fix the DreamLab deployment has
  pinned since 2026-08-25 (`a754468`).
- **`bench_keys` benchmark** (`f18b471`).

### Changed

- **bbs-client mobile refit T2**: wrapping post cards, button menu, legible
  images (`2730b7a`).
- **forum-client**: "Mark all read" and "Clear" stamp per-channel read
  positions (`93dcf05`).

### Fixed

- rustfmt applied across the beta.10 landing; the receipts projection row
  type is named (`FakeReceiptRow`); rustdoc links resolve through public
  re-exports (`7b2a126`).

### Documentation

- ADR corpus consolidated into a living ground truth with a thin ledger and
  the operative decision pack (`7795af5`, `6da33a7`); the beta.10 ADR pack
  lands with `486ec5a`.

## [1.0.0-beta.9] — 2026-08-20

Feature-parity and security-hardening release; every kit crate moves to
`1.0.0-beta.9`. The `nostr` dependency is pinned to an exact patch and the
`nostr-bbs-core` crypto shims track the current upstream error surface.

### Added

- **Owner-control ACL invariant (pod-worker).** Raw JSON-LD ACL `PUT`s now go
  through `preserves_owner_control`, guaranteeing the owner's `acl:Control`
  grant survives a caller-supplied ACL document (owner cannot be locked out of
  their own pod).
- **`futures-util`** added to the workspace dependency set.
- Security-audit tooling and records: `scripts/security-audit.sh`,
  `scripts/validate-forum-config.sh`, a `validate-forum-config` config binary,
  `docs/audit/2026-08-20-*`, and `docs/security/advisory-exceptions.md`.

### Changed

- **Pin `nostr` `0.44` → `0.44.7`** (exact patch) with the
  `nip04`/`nip44`/`nip59`/`nip98` features. The `nostr-bbs-core` crypto modules
  delegate to the rust-nostr NIP implementations.
- **NIP-98 canonical URL is now exact (auth-worker).** `canonical_url` returns
  the full request URL verbatim (query string preserved) when handed one,
  falling back to `origin + path` only for a bare origin; the request handler
  threads `url.to_string()` directly and the `request_origin` helper is removed.
  This makes NIP-98 verification of query-bearing admin routes
  (`?limit=…&before=…`) sign against the exact URL the client signed.
- Workspace-wide `rustfmt` normalisation.

### Fixed

- **nip44:** upstream `MessageTooLong` / `ErrorV2::MessageTooLong` now map to
  the kit's `Nip44Error::PlaintextTooLong` instead of a generic payload error.

### Removed

- **pod-worker: `pod_git_anchor.rs`.** Native Git anchoring is intentionally not
  implemented in the Worker crate; the dead module (and its 654 lines) is gone.

## [1.0.0-beta.8] — 2026-07-26

Hotfix release on top of `beta.7`, published the same day: moving off the
yanked `nostr 0.44.x` range surfaced two compile breaks in the published
crates. `beta.7` is yanked on crates.io (it only builds against yanked
`nostr` versions); consumers should move straight to `beta.8`.

### Fixed

- **`nostr` 0.44.2 → 0.44.6** — the entire `0.44.0–0.44.4` range is yanked
  on crates.io; the kit's lockfile was on `0.44.2`, and the freshly
  published `beta.7` crates could not compile in a downstream fresh resolve
  (which selects `0.44.6`). The two upstream error enums gained variants:
  `nip04::Error::InvalidIVLen` now maps into the kit's
  `Nip04Error::UpstreamCryptoError` (the kit's own wire pre-check already
  reports `InvalidIvLength(n)` with the real length before delegating), and
  `nip44::v2::ErrorV2::PayloadTooShort` maps to
  `Nip44Error::InvalidPayload("payload too short")`. Full workspace green
  on `0.44.6`.

## [1.0.0-beta.7] — 2026-07-26

Workspace release: every kit crate moves to `1.0.0-beta.7`; the six library
crates (`nostr-bbs-core`, `-config`, `-mesh`, `-rate-limit`, `-ascii`,
`-setup-skill`) are published to crates.io. Restores the registry == git-HEAD
invariant after the solid-pod-rs pin advanced on `main`.

### Changed

- **Adopt solid-pod-rs `0.5.0-alpha.7` — did:nostr CG spec 0.1.1** (pin
  `=0.5.0-alpha.4` → `=0.5.0-alpha.7`). DID documents now carry the
  three-context `@context` (`[did/v1, cid/v1, nostr/context]`, DID Core
  first as DID Core requires). Production rendering fully delegates to
  upstream; the tier1 tests, the did-doc-conformance fixture's positive
  vectors, and the context docstrings move to the three-context shape in
  lockstep. Both context forms expand identically under JSON-LD, so peers
  parsing (rather than byte-comparing) documents are unaffected.

## [1.0.0-beta.6] — 2026-07-19

Workspace release: every kit crate moves to `1.0.0-beta.6`; the four library
crates (`nostr-bbs-core`, `-config`, `-mesh`, `-rate-limit`) are published to
crates.io so consumers can pivot off the git-SHA pin.

### Security & hardening (full-stack audit remediation, two passes)

- **Device-key proof-of-possession** (auth-worker): device registration now
  requires a device-key-signed proof (kind-27236 committing to owner + short
  expiry, verified via the canonical Schnorr path) and rejects binding a key
  that is already a known principal — closing a latent silent admin-lockout /
  identity-hijack primitive.
- **NIP-42 AUTH across Durable Object hibernation** (relay): the per-session
  challenge is persisted to DO storage and restored on `recover_session`
  (previously a fresh challenge was minted that the client never saw, breaking
  AUTH permanently across the hibernation boundary).
- **Relay moderation/access**: ban gate widened from kinds 1/42 to all
  user-content kinds; new channels no longer default write-locked to admins;
  admin-status cache TTL cut 5 min → 30 s; `recover_session` no longer holds a
  `RefMut` across `.await`.
- **Publish hygiene**: the crate-wide `#![allow(dead_code)]` is removed from
  the worker crates and scoped to the wasm entry points, and the genuinely
  orphaned code it masked is deleted — so the published crates ship with the
  compiler's dead-code guard intact.
- **Client cleanup discipline**: a systemic `on_cleanup` sweep fixes leaked
  document listeners / timers / observers (modal keydown + scroll-lock,
  message-input draft/mention timers, link-preview observer, global-search
  debounce, offline-banner listeners, admin auto-dismiss) that fired against
  disposed reactive scopes after unmount.
- `solid-pod-rs` pinned exact (`=0.5.0-alpha.4`) so the crates.io pivot cannot
  silently forward-drift.

(Related `solid-pod-rs` criticals — an unverified deposit oracle and an SSRF
cluster — are fixed in that repository, not this kit.)


### Added

- **Zone URL slugs** (operator issue #45). Zones may carry a `slug` in
  operator config (validated: lowercase kebab, unique, no collision with
  another zone's id) — the URL segment decouples from the immutable zone id,
  so operators can rename addresses without orphaning channels. Short
  top-level routes (`/<zone>`, `/<zone>/<section>`, `/<zone>/<section>/<topic>`)
  alias the `/forums/*` tree (which keeps working for old links); pages
  resolve the param as slug-or-id, and every zone link now emits the short
  slug form (tiles, cards, breadcrumb targets, zone-first forwarding,
  mobile nav, home CTA).

### Fixed

- **Residual brand-amber accents on zone surfaces** (operator issue #43
  follow-up). Hover states (index card glow, section-card borders,
  breadcrumb links), "N new"/unread chips, message-count chips, New Topic
  affordances, form focus rings and spinners now follow `--zone-accent`
  via CSS custom-property utilities with a brand-amber fallback — a no-op
  outside zone scopes, so non-zone surfaces keep the site brand colour.

- **Admin new-joiner alerts.** A notification producer polls the whitelist
  (NIP-98, admin-gated) while an admin is signed in and raises a JoinRequest
  bell notification for each member holding no zone-gating cohort — i.e.
  joiners awaiting a zone grant when no `auto_approve` zone is configured.
  Alerts link to the admin panel, dedupe via a persisted seen-set, exclude
  agents/admins, and collapse bursts (>5 unseen) into one summary. Pairs
  with removing `auto_approve` from operator config: new joiners then get
  the public zone only, see other zones as locked tiles, and admins are
  alerted to grant access.

- **Post deletion — own posts for everyone, any post for admins** (operator
  issue #44 follow-up). NIP-09 kind-5 deletion end-to-end: the relay's
  `process_deletion` now honours the privilege its EVENT gate already
  admitted (admin/TL3+ may delete others' events — previously the SQL's
  author constraint made that a silent no-op; without the privilege the
  constraint remains, so a gate regression cannot widen deletion). The
  forum client subscribes to kind-5, folds deletions arrival-order
  independently via a tombstone set (a deletion seen before its target
  still suppresses it), and gains quiet author-or-admin trash affordances
  with confirm dialogs on thread roots (warns the whole topic disappears),
  replies, and chat bubbles, with optimistic removal on relay OK.

- **Straight-to-forums root + About page** (operator issue #42). `/` now
  redirects authenticated members to `/forums` (holding on the loading
  spinner until the session resolves, so neither branch flashes); the
  logged-out landing is unchanged at `/` and is always reachable at the new
  `/about` route. The header's zone-first "Forums" nav item is removed (the
  brand wordmark is the forums link) and a low-key "About" item joins the
  desktop and mobile navs.
- **Admin channel rename/describe via kind-41** (operator issue #44). The
  channel store now subscribes to kinds 40+41 and folds JSON
  `{name, about, picture}` metadata updates into channel state — last-write-
  wins by a metadata timestamp floored at the kind-40 `created_at`,
  pin/unpin kind-41s (empty content) ignored, 41-before-40 buffered.
  Admin-only pencil on section cards opens a shared-Modal edit dialog
  (name ≤80, about ≤280) publishing `["e", cid, "", "root"]` +
  `["section", …]`-tagged kind-41s; the relay's existing TL2-own/TL3-any
  gate is unchanged. Forum-index cards for single-channel sections now show
  the live channel name/description instead of a stale hardcoded map.

### Fixed

- **Forums index ignored configured zone colours** (operator issue #43). The
  index had a local zone-id-hash → arbitrary-Tailwind-palette picker, so
  tiles never reflected `[[zones]] accent_hex`. Zone accents are now
  resolved config-first (`resolved_accent_hex`) and drive the tile border,
  gradient wash, 4px accent edge stripe, heading colour, empty-zone CTA and
  every category card via inline `hex_rgba` styles — one colour per zone,
  index through drill-down, with the zone name text always present so
  colour is never the only signal.

## [1.0.0-beta.5] — 2026-07-18

Workspace release: every crate changed since its last version stamp moves to
`1.0.0-beta.5` (ascii, auth-worker, bbs-client, config, core, forum-client,
mesh, pod-worker, preview-worker, relay-worker); `rate-limit`,
`search-worker`, `setup-skill` and `upstream-canary` are unchanged and keep
their prior versions.

### Added

- **Zone-bound one-shot BBS PWA (ADR-109).** A single-locked-zone member can
  install their zone as a mobile app: a gated "Install mobile app" Settings
  section (forum-client) takes explicit consent with a lost-phone warning and
  bakes the key on-device (non-extractable AES-256-GCM wrap in IndexedDB +
  BootProfile); the BBS ships a manifest + maskable icons + a network-first
  service worker, boots one-shot via `?pwa=1` pinned to the bound zone, and
  handles iOS home-screen storage isolation with a one-time first-launch
  rebind. Shared contract in `nostr-bbs-core::boot_profile`; feature is gated
  on `window.__ENV__.BBS_PWA_ENABLED` (default off). Design trio:
  `docs/prd/prd-zone-bound-bbs-pwa.md`,
  `docs/archive/adr/ADR-109-zone-bound-bbs-pwa-install.md`,
  `docs/ddd/ddd-zone-bound-bbs-pwa.md`.
- **Quote-and-append topic replies** (forum-client). Every post in a topic
  carries a "Reply" that quotes that message and appends the reply at the
  bottom (flat, chronological, never nested); the card shows an inline quote
  and the quoted author is p-tagged. Threading stays correct by structure:
  the NIP-10 `reply` marker always targets the topic root, the quoted sibling
  rides a separate `quote` marker.
- **Per-zone auto-approval** (auth-worker + relay-worker + config). Zones gain
  an `auto_approve` flag; new joiners are additively granted an auto-approved
  zone's `required_cohorts` at username-claim time.

### Fixed

- **Avatar survives login** (forum-client): the auto-whitelist kind-0
  republish now consults the relay's existing profile and merges, instead of
  clobbering `picture`/`about`/`birthday` on every reconnect.
- **Media serves with its real MIME** (forum-client + pod-worker): uploads
  send the blob's type (extension fallback), and the pod-worker recovers
  `image/*` from the path for legacy `application/octet-stream` objects — so
  images render in `<img>` (nosniff) and reach the BBS ASCII transform.
- **Posted images no longer print their pod URL** (forum-client): embedded
  media URLs are stripped from the visible body; the embed carries a
  hover-revealed "open full" affordance instead.
- **BBS resolves author nyms** (bbs-client): board threads, chat, topic list,
  snippets and DM rows resolve kind-0 display names instead of raw truncated
  pubkeys.
- **Forum→BBS sash navigates** (forum-client): `rel="external"` + an explicit
  hard navigation so the Leptos router no longer intercepts the click into a
  404.
- **Photo upload 403** (forum-client): pod provisioning uses
  `POST /pods/{pubkey}/.provision` and the upload self-heals (provision +
  retry) on 403/404.
- **One-deep channel replies** (forum-client): a channel message that is
  itself a reply no longer offers a Reply affordance.
- **New-joiner signup race** (forum-client): kind-0 publish retries until the
  whitelist claim lands, and zone access refreshes after the claim; the forum
  service worker no longer intercepts `<base>/bbs/` navigations.


Soak-test fix sprint (2026-07-16) — 16 issues surfaced by a 10-persona browser
soak of `nostr-bbs-forum-client`; see the operator overlay's
`docs/sprint/soak-test-2026-07-16.md`. All changes are confined to
`nostr-bbs-forum-client`. Issue numbers below follow the in-code `#N` references.

### Fixed

- **Breadcrumb separators** unified to a styled `›` (was a bare `/`) across the
  Settings, Events, Glossary, Note and Pod-browser breadcrumbs, all now using
  the shared `.breadcrumb-separator` class.
- **Settings — Username section** no longer renders for accounts without a
  legacy handle. Onboarding captures a display name only, so the card is now
  reactive and appears solely to release a still-resolving legacy handle;
  everyone else manages their display name under Profile. (#6)
- **Settings — display-name length** is now stated honestly: a live `n/50`
  counter, helper copy, and an at-limit message, instead of clipping silently at
  50 characters. (#13)
- **Humanised error messages** for avatar/media upload, whitelist / zone-access
  lookup, and channel creation. The user sees a friendly, actionable message;
  the raw `JsValue` / fetch detail goes to the browser console rather than the
  UI. (#14/#16)
- **Avatar upload input-reset ordering** — the file `<input>` value is no longer
  cleared before the blob bytes are read (which invalidated the selected `File`
  in some browsers, surfacing `NotFoundError`). It is cleared only in early
  returns that never touch the blob and in the upload's terminal branch, still
  letting a re-select of the same file re-fire `change`. (#16)
- **Notifications — own join suppression**: never raise a "New member" alert for
  the signed-in user's own join. (#8)
- **Notifications — per-pubkey baseline**: the sync baseline and dedup set are
  now keyed per pubkey, so a recovery-key login (a different account on the same
  device) starts from a fresh `now()` floor and never inherits the previous
  user's history — the cause of the stale historical-join backlog. A one-time
  backlog snapshot records already-known members without notifying, while genuine
  post-baseline joins still notify (the dropped-join trap). (#10/#12/#15)
- **Notification drawer outside-click** is now a capture-phase document
  `pointerdown` listener instead of a full-viewport click-catcher `<div>`, which
  swallowed the first click on controls behind it — most visibly the header
  "Log Out" button. The underlying control now receives the same click. (#9)
- **nsec / local-key recovery login** rehydrates the account's kind-0 profile
  (display name + avatar) from the relay projection, so the header shows the real
  identity instead of a truncated pubkey until the user re-saves. Fire-and-forget,
  silent on failure, and never clobbers an in-session edit. (#11)
- **Forums welcome greeting** trims trailing whitespace and punctuation from the
  display name, so a name ending in a title suffix (e.g. "…, PhD,") no longer
  renders "Welcome, …,!".
- **Auto-whitelist for name-less users**: a brand-new user with no display name
  and no claimed handle now registers for auto-whitelist by publishing a minimal
  kind-0 — but only when the relay holds none, so an existing profile is never
  clobbered. Previously such a user could be authenticated yet permanently unable
  to post. (#5)

### Changed

- **Governance empty states** are now role-aware. Members see read-only "About
  governance" guidance; admins see the management-surface copy naming the
  Approve/Reject controls and a "Register an agent" affordance to get the first
  policy flowing.
- **Nav label** "Agents" renamed to "Governance" (desktop and mobile).
- **Empty zones** show admins a "Create a section" CTA that deep-links to the
  admin panel's Channels tab (`/admin?tab=channels`), where sections are actually
  created; members keep the informational copy and a link back to Forums.
- **Channel-creation pending state** now tracks the full async publish lifecycle
  (relay ack, rejection, or ~10 s timeout) via `AdminState.channel_creating`,
  with a one-shot guard so a late ack cannot overwrite a timeout error; the create
  button re-enables for retry.
- **Admin Settings "Default Zone"** options derive from the live `ZONE_CONFIG`
  rather than a hardcoded legacy zone list.

### Added

- **Zone-first landing and scoped navigation** ([ADR-107](docs/archive/adr/ADR-107-zone-first-landing-and-scoped-navigation.md)):
  a member authorised for exactly one locked zone now lands on that zone instead
  of the generic forums index. The home zone is derived client-side from
  `ZONE_CONFIG × cohorts` via `Zone::is_member` (`home_zone_for`) — exactly one
  accessible locked zone, admins exempt, no hardcoded zone ids. The `/forums`
  index auto-forwards to the zone root with replace navigation (so "back" skips
  the bare index); the header + mobile nav anchor is re-labelled to the zone and
  points at the zone root; and the zone-page breadcrumb re-roots to
  `Home › {Zone}` (dropping the global "Forums" crumb). Multi-zone members and
  admins are unchanged, deep links and the `returnTo` flow (ADR-090) are
  untouched, and the feature is dormant when no `ZONE_CONFIG` locked zone matches
  the member's cohorts.
- **Admin panel deep-linking**: `/admin?tab=<slug>` opens the panel on a named
  tab (channels, users, pending, sections, settings, reports, audit, pods…).
- **`dev-auth` cargo feature** (off by default): pre-provisioned deterministic
  dev identities (admin / user / jarvis), a floating identity picker, a
  zone-access bypass, and a local jarvis DM echo-bot for offline UI testing
  without touching the relay whitelist. Not compiled into release builds.

BBS mobile-first redesign — "split the difference" (2026-07); see
[ADR-108](docs/archive/adr/ADR-108-bbs-mobile-first-redesign.md) and the operator
overlay's `docs/sprint/bbs-redesign-2026-07.md`. Reimagines the retro BBS client
(`nostr-bbs-bbs-client`, served at `/community/bbs/`) after a live mobile UX
audit: the phosphor skin, ASCII image rendering, numbered menu and keyboard model
are kept, while the modem-era interaction grammar is replaced by the main forum's
proven patterns. Delivered in three tranches — **all shipped**: T1 (F1–F6),
T2 (F7, F10, F13–F15) and T3 (F8, F9, F11, F12). Feature-matched to the main
board and verified by mobile-emulated browser testing and an adversarial review
panel (which caught and fixed a cross-account DM leak before release).

### Added

- **BBS onboarding landing (F3)** — a logged-out newcomer now sees a
  plain-language "what is this / why join" hero with value-prop chips and three
  stacked ≥44 px CTAs (**Sign in** · **Create account** → `/community/` ·
  **Look around**) before the numbered menu, replacing the trope-soup landing
  that offered only a jargon menu and a buried `[0] Help`. The masthead is now a
  compact, config-driven `NODE_NAME` + `TAGLINE` text masthead
  (`window.__ENV__`) instead of box-glyph art, so it is legible at 360 px and
  carries operator branding without a fork. *(T1)*
- **BBS mobile sign-in sheet (F1/F2)** — the cramped single-line `.bbs-cmdline`
  sign-in row is rebuilt as a vertical stack of full-width, ≥44 px,
  nowrap-labelled options in priority order: extension (if a NIP-07 provider is
  present) → **Continue at `/community/`** (passkey/WebAuthn, session adopted
  back — the extension-free primary path) → paste nsec/hex → generate a throwaway
  key. The input gains an `id`/`name` for autofill. Fixes the broken 32 px
  buttons and the missing extension-free path on real iOS Safari / Android
  Chrome. *(T1)*
- **BBS zones-as-cards navigation (F4/F5)** — the flat, all-zones-at-once board
  list becomes a Zones → Boards → Threads → Thread drill-down: one accent card
  per configured zone, a left-side always-visible zone chip on board rows
  (replacing the clipped right-appended `@handle`), channel/profile names
  resolved before hex, a real tappable `← Back` control and a `Zone › Board`
  breadcrumb (replacing the dead `[ESC] back to boards` label), and top-anchored
  content with friendly empty states. Overflow drops from a measured 101–128 px
  to 0 px at 360/390. Depth is added via new `BbsState` signals, keeping the
  non-routed state machine (`leptos_router` deliberately not adopted). *(T1)*
- **BBS persistent bottom nav (F6)** — a skinned terminal bottom bar
  (Menu / Boards / DMs / Agents / You), auth-gated like the forum's, replaces the
  undocumented swipe-from-top return path (swipe kept as an accelerator). *(T1)*
- **BBS three-state status bar** — connected-but-unauthenticated now shows
  `◐ SIGN IN TO READ` (linking to the sign-in sheet) instead of an ambiguous
  `○ CONNECTING` that read as "node down". *(T1)*

### Changed

- **BBS hotkeys demoted to accelerators** — every hotkey now has a visible,
  tappable twin, and keyboard-centric in-content copy ("Keys: … ESC back",
  "Sign in ([9] Settings)") is reworded tap-first with the key hint as a
  parenthetical. The full keyboard model, four CRT themes and the UA 571-C sentry
  door game are retained unchanged. *(T1)*

### Fixed

- **BBS ASCII image render fallback (F10)** — a pod-hosted image whose direct
  `?format=ascii` fetch does not return an ASCII fragment (a local `solid-pod-rs`
  dev pod ignores the param and serves the raw image as
  `application/octet-stream`, failing the `text/html` gate; an owner-only `.acl`
  401s) no longer dead-ends at `[ image unavailable ]`. `AsciiImg` now tries an
  ordered candidate list — pod-direct first, then the preview-worker's `/ascii`
  route over the public pod URL — and injects the first `text/html` fragment,
  degrading to `[ image unavailable ]` only when every route fails. No raw
  `JsValue`, no WASM panic. *(T2)*

### Added (T2 / T3)

- **Threaded topics (F7)** — boards drill Zones → Boards → **Thread list**
  (root kind-42s with reply count + last activity) → **Thread view** (root +
  `e`-tagged replies, chronological); legacy unthreaded posts render as
  single-post threads. *(T2)*
- **In-composer image upload (F10)** — a `[ ▸ image ]` affordance validates
  (`is_accepted_image`, 5 MB cap) with friendly terminal errors, compresses
  client-side, uploads to the viewer's pod over **NIP-98 PUT**
  (`upload_to_pod_signer`), posts the URL, and renders it inline as phosphor
  ASCII. *(T2)*
- **Accessibility/density prefs (F13)** — Settings toggles for text size and
  reduced motion, persisted to `localStorage` and applied as root classes;
  reduced motion defaults to the OS `prefers-reduced-motion`. *(T2)*
- **nsec backup sheet (F14)** — a shown-once key backup (copy + written-it-down
  confirm, no-reset warning) after a throwaway key is generated and for any
  readable local key in Settings. *(T2)*
- **Profile detail (F15)** — member rows are tappable to a kind-0 profile panel
  (name / about / short-id / `did:nostr` WebID). *(T2)*
- **Encrypted DMs incl. Jarvis 1:1 (F8)** — a NIP-44/59 gift-wrapped DM screen
  (inbox → per-peer thread → composer) over a dedicated NIP-42-authenticated DM
  socket, with a one-tap "Message Jarvis" quick-start. Decrypted state is wiped
  on sign-out / account switch (app-root owner watcher). *(T3)*
- **Native passkey sign-in (F9)** — WebAuthn PRF → HKDF-derived Nostr key
  (byte-identical to the forum's derivation, so a BBS passkey resolves to the
  same identity as one made at `/community/`), adopted in-memory via the same
  install path as generate/paste; feature-detected and gracefully absent when
  unsupported. *(T3)*
- **Global search (F11)** — a phosphor search palette (Ctrl/Cmd+K accelerator +
  a `/search` command + a tappable affordance) over the search-worker, graceful
  when the worker is unreachable. *(T3)*
- **Notifications (F12)** — a bottom-bar unread badge for replies/mentions, with
  own-event suppression and a **per-pubkey first-seen baseline** so a fresh login
  never surfaces the historical backlog; visible items are scoped per pubkey so a
  new viewer on a shared device sees none of the prior owner's. *(T3)*

  T2/T3 close shared-crate reuse (`image_compress`, `pod_client`, `dm`,
  `search_client`, `auth/{passkey,webauthn}`) over the common `Signer` trait
  rather than new domain code.

## [1.0.0-beta.4] - 2026-07-08

### Changed

- **nostr-bbs-core** bumped to `1.0.0-beta.4` (did-doc canonicalisation gate,
  shared WAC/did:nostr policy from solid-pod-rs `0.5.0-alpha.4`). The other 13
  crates remain at `1.0.0-beta.3` per ADR-103 (only the changed crate bumps).
- **solid-pod-rs** dependency raised to `0.5.0-alpha.4`.

### Added

- **COM-13/F2** Agent disclosure badge — renders at all author sites; public
  `/api/agents/disclosure` endpoint for transparency.
- **F8** Admin Agents roster tab — wired to the nine `/api/governance/*`
  endpoints for operator-managed agent lifecycle.
- **F1** Member read-only view of agent roster.
- **COM-16/COM-17** Decision integrity and graduated escalation enforcement.
- **REC-6** Escalation-default projection for new operator deployments.
- **F6** Supersession authority aligned to canonical DDD §7a.
- **NIP-07** Browser-extension signing (PodKey/nos2x/Alby).
- Zone hero board grouping — boards interleaved under their zone hero banner.

### Fixed

- Closeout security audit remediation (shared WAC/did:nostr policy).
- DID-doc fixture converged to CID/v1 and ADR-125 canonical form.
- WoT registration gate fail-closed on settings-read D1 error.

## [ADR backfill] - 2026-06-11

### Added

- **ADR index / register** (`docs/adr/README.md`): canonical register of ADR-086
  onward, listing the three sprint-resident ADRs (090/091/092 under
  `docs/sprint/2026-05-17-ux-audit/`), noting ADR-102 as incoming (trust demotion),
  and recording the numbering-authority convention (sequential, unique, this dir
  canonical; ADRs 001–085 are the upstream/historical kit record, not filed here).
  Closes register gap **G6**.
- **ADR-100 — Key lifecycle** (`docs/adr/`): three-tier key model (root /
  purpose-subkey / device key); device keys absorb day-to-day exposure so root
  rotation stays a rare, identity-fatal last resort; compromise-response playbook
  by scope; ordering invariant **revoke → rotate → re-enrol**. Reconciles ADR-094's
  no-compromise-isolation disclaimer with ADR-099's `device_keys.revoked`.
- **ADR-101 — Multi-device NIP-17 DM delivery** (`docs/adr/`): the ADR-099 phase-2
  deferral. Our client multi-wraps each DM to the recipient's master **and** each
  registered non-revoked device key; graceful degradation when an outside client
  reaches only the master; relay admission unchanged (per ADR-104). Implementation
  deferred — `forum-client/src/dm/mod.rs` send-path expansion + auth-worker per-owner
  device lookup; relay untouched.
- **ADR-103 — Kit semver / publish / yank policy** (`docs/adr/`): defines
  API-breaking (removing any `pub` item — the `!` commits dropping `nip26`/`nip90`),
  `1.0.0-beta.N` line semantics (breaking bumps the beta counter, not major; betas
  don't auto-match), next publish is **1.0.0-beta.3**, yank-for-defect-only policy,
  and the SHA-pin downstream contract (downstream overlays pin by SHA). Codifies the R2/R4
  audit findings.
- **ADR-104 — NIP-59 gift-wrap recipient admission + relay gating** (`docs/adr/`):
  documents the implemented rule — the relay admits kind-1059 by **recipient `#p`
  whitelist membership**, never the ephemeral author, without decrypting. Privacy
  boundary (relay is a zero-knowledge router), device-key effective-pubkey
  attribution, and why DM `#p` is deliberately **not** rebound to the owner
  (`relay_do/nip_handlers.rs:649-657`). References `docs/diagrams/relay-event-admission.md`.

> ADR-102 (trust demotion, anomaly O1) is reserved and owned by concurrent
> `relay-worker/src/trust.rs` work; it lands with that change.

## [Upstream kit features] - 2026-06-11

### Added

- **ADR-094 — Deterministic purpose-scoped subkey derivation** (`nostr-bbs-core`):
  `derive_subkey(root, tag)` = HMAC-SHA-256(root_sk, tag) → validated secp256k1
  `SecretKey`. One canonical primitive (native + wasm bridge) for rotatable,
  recoverable, purpose-scoped child keys; byte-for-byte parity with agentbox's
  JS mirror derivation, pinned by a known-answer vector (root `0x01`×32 + tag
  `agentbox-mirror-v1` → `2d07f2ce…695d`). Domain separation, not compromise
  isolation — revocable delegation is provided by device keys (ADR-099);
  NIP-26 was evaluated and rejected.
- **ADR-095 — Recovery & device-onboarding sheet** (`nostr-bbs-forum-client`):
  a `RecoverySheet` Leptos component renders a 100% client-side printable
  one-page sheet at signup (nsec/npub/relay QRs + metadata + restore steps +
  optional relay "sweep" block), Save-as-PDF via `window.print()`. Additive to
  `NsecBackup`; insist-with-override exit gate; target mobile client is 0xchat
  (NIP-17/28/42). The nsec never leaves WASM; ncryptsec/NIP-49 deferred.
- **ADR-096 — ACL container resolution + per-container delegation**
  (`nostr-bbs-pod-worker`): `find_effective_acl` now probes the per-container
  sidecar `<dir>/.acl` at every walk-up level (with correct `inherited` flags),
  fixing the previously-unreachable container ACL. Adds `build_delegation_acl`
  and an opt-in `PUT {"@delegation":{agent,modes}}` to `<container>/.acl`;
  `acl:Control` is never delegated and owner Control is always preserved.
  Retires the flat-sidecar workaround (migration is non-breaking).
- **ADR-097 — Consolidated agent identity provisioning** (`nostr-bbs-auth-worker`):
  `POST /api/governance/agents/provision` (NIP-98 admin) performs the whitelist
  upsert + `agent_registry` upsert atomically in one D1 `batch()`, replacing the
  four-call seed dance. Idempotent on `pubkey`; `/register` and
  `/api/whitelist/add` unchanged. The agent's kind-0/NIP-65 stay client-side.

## [3.0.0-rc11] - 2026-05-17

### Added

- **Native pod support**: `[native_pod]` config section in nostr-bbs-config; when
  `native_pod.enabled = true`, pod browser shows a second "Native pod" card probing
  the native server URL. Available → GitPanel + AppManifestPanel. Probing/Unavailable
  states handled gracefully.
- **Admin: Native Pods tab**: provision a native pod for any user pubkey via the admin
  control panel. Calls CF auth-worker `POST /api/native-pod/provision` → forwards to
  native server `/_admin/provision/{pubkey}` with PSK header.
- `NATIVE_POD_URL` build-time env wires the forum client to the native server URL.

## [3.0.0-rc10] - 2026-05-17

### Added

- **Git control panel** (`components/git_panel.rs`): VS Code–style Source
  Control panel for in-pod git repositories. Staged/unstaged/untracked file
  sections with per-file stage, unstage, discard, and inline diff viewer
  (green/red syntax colouring). Commit textarea + button. Lazy-loaded commit
  history. Busy guard prevents concurrent mutations. Shows "Git API not
  available" gracefully on CF Workers (HTTP 404/501).
- **App manifest panel** (JSS #464): `AppManifestPanel` below the git card;
  GET/PUT `{pod}/apps/manifest.json` with NIP-98 auth. Enables pods as
  first-class app distribution repositories.
- **Auto-probe on pod mount**: `pod_browser` fires a one-shot `Effect::new`
  when `pod_base_url` and signer are ready. No manual "Check Git" button.
  `Available` → git card + panels; `Unavailable` → compact note; `Probing` →
  spinner. CF Workers settle immediately to `Unavailable`.
- **solid-pod-rs pinned to alpha.14** (`rev = "4ac7670"`): nine `/_git/*`
  REST endpoints, `/.well-known/apps` discovery, GAP-ANALYSIS E.1 SHIPPED.

### Fixed

- **JSS v0.0.197 pod HTTP parity for the Worker tier**: Solid-compatible CORS
  envelope, `WWW-Authenticate` on 401 responses, notification discovery via
  `Updates-Via`, and authenticated `POST /.pods` returning `{ name, webId,
  podUri }`.
- **Provisioned media containers**: new pods now include `media/` and
  `media/public/`, matching the forum-client image upload destination.
- **Pod browser TypeIndex link** now points at
  `/settings/publicTypeIndex.jsonld`, matching the provisioned Solid document.

## [3.0.0-rc7] -- 2026-05-12

Agent Control Surface Protocol: governance types, relay integration, REST API,
forum UI, and D1 migration. The forum becomes a universal human-in-the-loop
control plane for any agent system.

### Added

- **Agent Control Surface Protocol** (kinds 31400-31405). Six new parameterized
  replaceable event kinds for agent-published control panels: PanelDefinition,
  PanelState, ActionRequest, ActionResponse, PanelUpdate, PanelRetired. Agents
  declare interactive panels via nostr events; the forum renders them as
  decision surfaces; humans respond with cryptographically signed events.
- **`nostr_bbs_core::governance` module** (1003 LOC, 19 tests). Full domain
  model: `PanelDefinition`, `ActionRequest`/`ActionResponse`, `BrokerCase`
  aggregate root with `DecisionOrchestrator`, `RegisteredAgent` types,
  tag-extraction helpers, governance kind-range constants. Ported from
  VisionClaw ADR-041/057 with framework-agnostic design.
- **`governance_api.rs`** in auth-worker. Seven NIP-98-gated REST endpoints:
  `GET/POST /api/governance/agents{,/register,/revoke}`,
  `GET /api/governance/cases{,:id}`,
  `POST /api/governance/roles/grant`, `GET /api/governance/roles`.
  Admin-only registration/revocation/role-grant; authenticated read for all.
- **Agent registry gate in relay-worker**. Governance events (kinds 31400-31405)
  from agent pubkeys are validated against the `agent_registry` D1 table at
  relay ingress. Unregistered agents are rejected. `ActionResponse` (kind 31403)
  from humans passes through standard NIP-98 auth.
- **Action request projection to `broker_cases`**. Kind 31402 events are
  projected into the `broker_cases` D1 table for queryable governance inbox.
- **`0002_governance.sql` migration** for relay-worker. Creates four D1 tables:
  `agent_registry`, `broker_cases`, `broker_decisions`, `broker_roles` with
  appropriate indexes. Idempotent (IF NOT EXISTS).
- **Governance D1 tables in auth-worker schema**. Inline DDL in `schema.rs`
  mirrors the relay migration for the auth-worker's D1 database.
- **`GovernancePage`** in forum-client. Reactive dashboard at `/governance`
  showing active panels, pending actions, and registered agent count. Includes
  `PanelCard` (renders agent panel definitions with action buttons) and
  `ActionRow` (renders action requests with approve/reject signing via the
  user's nostr key).
- **`PanelRegistry` reactive store** in forum-client. Ingests governance events
  from the relay subscription, maintains `HashMap<d_tag, PanelEntry>` for panels
  and `Vec<ActionEntry>` for pending actions. Provided as Leptos context from
  `app.rs`.
- **Governance relay subscription** in `app.rs`. Subscribes to kinds 31400-31405
  and feeds events into `PanelRegistry`.
- **`AgentGovernance` service endpoint** in `did:nostr` Tier-3 DID documents.
  `nostr_bbs_core::did` now accepts a governance API URL and emits an
  `AgentGovernance` service endpoint in the DID document.
- **Navigation entry** for `/governance` in the forum client sidebar with
  dedicated icon.
- **Value assessment document**: `docs/sprint/enterprise-lift-value-assessment.md`
  covering the ADR, DDD domain model, MCP tool surface design, and cross-repo
  SSO alignment plan.
- **NIP-98 SSO parity report**: `docs/sprint/milestone-0-sso-parity.md`
  documenting the Schnorr pre-hashing mismatch between nostr-bbs-core and
  solid-pod-rs, with fix instructions.

### Changed

- **`nostr-bbs-core`** gains `governance` module (behind default feature).
  `BrokerCase` domain model with invariants: no self-review, append-only
  history, terminal state idempotency, provenance chain.
- **Relay-worker `handle_event`** extended with agent-kind routing block
  (same pattern as NIP-29 admin kinds) for governance event validation.
- **Auth-worker `lib.rs`** routes 7 new `/api/governance/*` paths.
- **Forum-client `app.rs`** provides `PanelRegistry` context and subscribes
  to governance events on relay connect.

## [Security Audit Sprint] - 2026-05-11

An ecosystem-wide security audit. 12 fixes applied to nostr-rust-forum
covering P0 critical, P1 high, P2 medium, and P3 housekeeping findings.

### Security

- **P0-01**: PRF salt is now server-derived in webauthn.rs, preventing
  client-controlled salt injection in passkey registration flows
- **P0-02**: Admin model checks both members and whitelist in relay auth.rs,
  closing a privilege-escalation path where non-whitelisted members could
  bypass admin gates
- **P0-03**: Replay DB binding corrected to REPLAY_DB in relay wrangler.toml;
  the previous binding name silently created a second empty D1 database,
  leaving the replay cache ineffective
- **R2-P0-01**: /pay/.cleanup endpoint now requires NIP-98 auth guard in
  payments.rs, preventing unauthenticated callers from triggering cleanup

### Fixed

- **P1-18**: Job settle/cancel operations are now atomic via
  UPDATE...WHERE in payments.rs, eliminating TOCTOU races between
  concurrent settle and cancel on the same job
- **P1-19**: Job IDs generated via CSPRNG (getrandom) in payments.rs,
  replacing the previous sequential/predictable scheme
- **P1-20**: Deterministic invite code fallback removed in invites.rs;
  all invite codes are now CSPRNG-generated with no weak fallback path
- **P2-01**: DID pubkey validated as 64-character lowercase hex in
  payments.rs, rejecting malformed did:nostr identifiers at the boundary
- **P2-02**: NIP-26 delegation handler returns 501 Not Implemented in
  delegation.rs instead of silently accepting unverified delegations
- **P2-03**: Admin cache uses 5-minute TTL in relay auth.rs, bounding
  stale-admin-list exposure after revocation
- **P3-02**: Job expiry column added to payments schema, with orphan
  recovery sweep and /pay/.cleanup endpoint for operator-initiated GC

### Removed

- **P3-01**: KvPaymentStore dead code removed from payments.rs; the KV
  backend was superseded by D1 but never cleaned up

## [3.0.0-rc6] -- 2026-05-11

Payments, security hardening, and upstream alignment.

### Added

- **HTTP 402 payments** (`/pay/` routes in pod-worker). Web Ledgers spec
  implementation: `.info`, `.balance`, `.deposit`, metered resource access,
  multi-chain TXO verification, `/.well-known/webledgers/webledgers.json`
  discovery. All identities are `did:nostr:<pubkey>` — users and agents
  are indistinguishable at the protocol level.
- **`Nip98Token.event_id`** field: canonical event ID (recomputed by
  `verify_event_strict`) carried through to replay caches. Eliminates the
  redundant `compute_event_id_from_header` re-parse.
- **Wrangler.toml KV bindings**: `ADMIN_KV`, `ADMIN_KV_RO`, `NIP98_REPLAY`
  provisioned across all 4 workers.
- **`PAY_ENABLED` / `PAY_COST_SATS`** env vars in pod-worker wrangler.toml.

### Fixed

- **NIP-98 URL matching** (JSS alignment): removed trailing-slash
  normalisation; exact match only, per JSS source of truth.
- **Quota overflow**: `check_quota` uses `checked_add()` to prevent
  arithmetic overflow on projected usage.
- **admins.rs KV cache write**: `.execute().await` was missing — the
  future was dropped without awaiting. Cache writes now persist.
- **Whitelist `update_cohorts`**: added 64-char hex validation on pubkey
  input (was only checking non-empty).
- **NIP-19 proptest relay generator**: simplified to avoid generating
  invalid IDN labels (`xn--` prefixes). All 13 proptests pass.

### Changed

- **solid-pod-rs**: upgraded to 0.4.0-alpha.7 (payments, LWS-CID, CID v1
  WebID terms, NIP-98 WebID elevation).
- **`d1_helpers`** extracted to `nostr-bbs-core` (shared by auth-worker
  and relay-worker). Gated on `cfg(target_arch = "wasm32")`.

## [3.0-rc1] -- 2026-05-07

Phase 2 kit-extraction import. Brings critical security fixes, the F26 upstream
canary crate, L1 reference-vector test scaffolds, and Phase-1 substrate scripts
across from the legacy operator fork (where
they were authored during the mega-sprint Phase 0 + Phase 1 windows).

### Fixed (Critical)

- **C1 -- NIP-44 v2 conversation-key interop bug** in `crates/nostr-core/src/nip44.rs`.
  The previous implementation chained `HKDF-Extract -> HKDF-Expand` and produced
  `HMAC(PRK, 0x01)` instead of the PRK itself, breaking interoperability with
  every reference NIP-44 v2 implementation. Replaced with direct
  `HMAC-SHA256(salt="nip44-v2", ikm=shared_x)`. Validated against
  `paulmillr/nip44` test vectors (`docs/specs/fixtures/nip44-v2.json` in
  VisionClaw monorepo). Refs: ADR-076 D5, mega-sprint Phase 0.

- **C5 -- NIP-42 AUTH challenge CSPRNG** in
  `crates/relay-worker/src/relay_do/session.rs`. Replaced
  `js_sys::Math::random()` (non-cryptographic PRNG) with `getrandom::getrandom`,
  which on the Cloudflare Workers runtime delegates to `crypto.getRandomValues`
  (a CSPRNG). Predictable challenges allow a network attacker to forge an AUTH
  response, so this is the entire security property of the handshake. Added
  `getrandom = { workspace = true }` to `crates/relay-worker/Cargo.toml`.
  Refs: ADR-082, mega-sprint Phase 0.

### Added

- **F26 -- `nostr-upstream-canary` crate** (`crates/nostr-upstream-canary/`).
  Smoke-tests the upstream `nostr` 0.44.2 crate (without `nostr-sdk`) on the
  forum's WASM/Cloudflare Workers build matrix. Three smokes: keypair
  round-trip, NIP-44 v2 conversation-key derivation against
  `paulmillr/nip44` vector 0, NIP-19 npub bech32 round-trip. PASS unblocks
  ADR-076 D5 module absorption (Shape A); FAIL records a Shape C
  patch-in-place fallback. Crate is `publish = false` and not linked into the
  forum binary. Refs: ADR-076 D5, PRD-009.

- **L1 -- reference-vector test scaffolds**
  (`crates/nostr-core/tests/upstream_vectors/`). Loader at `mod.rs` resolves
  fixtures from `tests/fixtures/` (or `VISIONCLAW_FIXTURE_ROOT` env var) and
  asserts metadata blocks. `all_fixtures.rs` wires one test per fixture across
  13 files: NIP-01/04/19/26/44-v2/59/98, BIP-340, RFC 8785, multibase, DID-Doc
  conformance, IS-envelope v1, mesh-federation. Tests skip cleanly when the
  fixture is absent so the bring-up window stays green. Run
  `scripts/sync-fixtures.sh` first to populate. Refs: ADR-082 D5.

- **Phase-1 substrate scripts**:
  - `scripts/sync-fixtures.sh` -- pulls cross-substrate fixtures from VisionClaw's
    `docs/specs/fixtures/` into `tests/fixtures/`, writes `CHECKSUM.txt` for CI
    drift detection. Supports `--verify` mode for CI gates and
    `VISIONCLAW_FIXTURES_PATH` for offline / local-monorepo dev.
  - `scripts/anti-drift-lint.sh` -- ADR-077 P3 anti-drift lint. Rejects
    Operator-specific Schnorr verification suite identifiers
    (`NostrSchnorrKey2024`, `SchnorrSecp256k1VerificationKey2022`/`2025`/`2026`)
    in favour of the canonical `SchnorrSecp256k1VerificationKey2019`. Rejects
    hand-rolled DID-Document emitters outside `crates/pod-worker/src/did.rs`
    and `crates/nostr-core/`. Exit non-zero on drift.

### Changed

- **`Cargo.toml` workspace members** -- added `crates/nostr-upstream-canary` so
  the canary participates in `cargo check --workspace` runs.

### Notes

- This release does **not** include the full Sprint v9-v11 feature set authored
  in the legacy fork (NIP-98 replay store, profiles backfill, username
  reservations, mesh service-list, Tailwind CDN replacement, etc.). Those land
  incrementally in Phase 3+.
- Crate renaming to a `nostr-bbs-*` prefix and the new `nostr-bbs-config`,
  `nostr-bbs-mesh`, `nostr-bbs-setup-skill` crates remain deferred.
- The `admin-cli` crate is operator-specific and stays in the legacy fork.

### Provenance

- Charter: RuVector key
  `project-state/mega-sprint-phase-2-kit-extraction-charter`.
- Final report: RuVector key
  `mega-sprint-2026-05-07/phase-2-kit-extraction-final-report`.
- Prior sprint reports: `mega-sprint-2026-05-07/phase-0-final-report`,
  `mega-sprint-2026-05-07/phase-1-final-report`.
