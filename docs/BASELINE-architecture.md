# Architecture Baseline — nostr-rust-forum

## Purpose

Single source of truth for how this repository is built today: the crate
topology, the two-tier pod mesh, the Cloudflare Workers portability constraints,
the status of the upstream `nostr` absorption, NIP-05 federation, ACL delegation,
kit publishing, and the two Leptos clients. Ground-truth order: **live code >
audit facts > legacy ADR prose**. Legacy ADRs (086–109, archived 2026-08-31) are
citable evidence, never authority. Identity, key derivation, device keys, DM
delivery and trust levels live in the sibling doc `IDENTITY-keys-and-trust.md`.

## Current State

### Workspace topology

A Cargo workspace (`resolver = "2"`, `edition = "2021"`, `rust-version = "1.85"`,
`Cargo.toml`) of 14 member crates in four layers (`Cargo.toml`
`[workspace.members]`):

- **Foundation** — `nostr-bbs-core`: the hand-rolled Nostr protocol primitives
  (event, keys, signer, NIP-04/19/44/59/98, gift-wrap, governance, moderation).
- **Config / federation** — `nostr-bbs-config`, `nostr-bbs-mesh`,
  `nostr-bbs-setup-skill`, `nostr-bbs-rate-limit`, `nostr-bbs-ascii`.
- **Cloudflare Worker reference implementations** — `nostr-bbs-auth-worker`,
  `nostr-bbs-pod-worker`, `nostr-bbs-preview-worker`, `nostr-bbs-relay-worker`,
  `nostr-bbs-search-worker`.
- **Clients (Leptos CSR)** — `nostr-bbs-forum-client` (modern forum) and
  `nostr-bbs-bbs-client` (retro ASCII/BBS terminal, served at `/community/bbs/`).
- **Validation** — `nostr-bbs-upstream-canary` (build canary; not linked into any
  binary).

The release profile is WASM-optimised (`opt-level = "z"`, `lto = true`,
`codegen-units = 1`, `strip = true`, `panic = "abort"`; `Cargo.toml`
`[profile.release]`) because the workers and both clients target
`wasm32-unknown-unknown`.

### Upstream `nostr` absorption — in-flight, not complete

The workspace **already depends on the upstream `nostr` crate**:
`nostr = { version = "0.44.7", features = ["nip04", "nip44", "nip59", "nip98"] }`
(`Cargo.toml` `[workspace.dependencies]`). The `nostr-bbs-upstream-canary` crate
exists to prove the absorption path (rust-nostr replacing hand-rolled crypto)
compiles and runs on this build matrix **before any `nostr-core` module is
deleted** — PASS records "Shape A" (full absorption), FAIL records "Shape C"
(patch-in-place) (`crates/nostr-bbs-upstream-canary/src/lib.rs:1-30`).

Crucially, **no `nostr-bbs-core` crypto module has been deleted**: the hand-rolled
`nip04.rs`, `nip44.rs`, `nip98.rs`, `gift_wrap.rs`, `keys.rs`, `signer.rs`, `event.rs`
and `nip19.rs` are all still present and are what the workers and clients link
against (`crates/nostr-bbs-core/src/`). The upstream dependency is enabled, the
canary is built, but the absorption itself is unfinished. Legacy upstream ADR-076
(status *Proposed*) understates this: the dependency and canary are live work; the
deletion is not done.

### Two-tier native pod mesh

Pods are served by two tiers (legacy ADR-093, which superseded ADR-089):

- **CF-Workers tier** (`nostr-bbs-pod-worker`) — pods as R2 prefixes; no
  filesystem, no `tokio::process`, no git. Non-git by design.
- **agentbox native tier** — the git-capable pod, resolving the git-pods gap that
  ADR-089 had deferred.

ACL is Web Access Control absorbed over `solid_pod_rs::wac`
(`crates/nostr-bbs-pod-worker/src/acl.rs:1`). The escalation guard
`coerce_required_mode_for_acl` funnels every `.acl`/`.meta` sidecar path to
`AccessMode::Control`, closing the read-side disclosure and write-side control-
coercion holes (`acl.rs:66-88`); per-container delegation is built structurally by
`build_delegation_acl` so the owner is never coerced out (`acl.rs:16`).

### CF-Workers portability constraints (open)

Three `solid-pod-rs` Phase-1 surfaces (`provision-keys`, `nip05-endpoint`,
`export-jsonld`) remain structurally unreachable from `wasm32` CF Workers — legacy
ADR-087 is *Draft, decision deferred*, so ADR-086's pod-federation fallback is
degenerate (the pod returns the same data D1 already holds). The related WAC Turtle
serializer bare-path IRI quirk (legacy ADR-088, *Draft, deferred*) has **zero live
impact** today because the pod-worker writes JSON-LD ACLs and never round-trips
Turtle. Both are latent-risk notes awaiting an upstream champion, not scheduled
work.

### NIP-05 federation & identity storage

NIP-05 usernames are a centrally-administered registry written at claim time into
the auth-worker's D1: `username_reservations(username, pubkey, created_at, …)`
under a pubkey-uniqueness invariant, with a pubkey index and a later `real_name`
column (`crates/nostr-bbs-auth-worker/src/schema.rs:208-232`). The claim/invite
path uses upsert-with-`DO NOTHING` to survive the SELECT-then-branch race
(`crates/nostr-bbs-auth-worker/src/invites.rs:217-225`).

### Kit publishing & versioning

The `nostr-bbs-*` crates are the publishable kit surface (legacy ADR-103). The
current in-tree version is **`1.0.0-beta.9`** (`crates/nostr-bbs-core/Cargo.toml:3`;
workspace path deps are pinned to `1.0.0-beta.9` in `Cargo.toml`). `solid-pod-rs`
is an **exact** pin (`=0.5.0-alpha.7`, `default-features = false`, `features =
["core"]`) so a caret range cannot silently pull a newer published alpha at resolve
time (`Cargo.toml`).

### Client surfaces

- **Forum client** (`nostr-bbs-forum-client`) — the `FORUM_BASE` prefix is added in
  exactly two places (`<Router base=>` and `base_href()`); every internal path is
  base-relative and the service-worker scope is computed against `FORUM_BASE`
  (`crates/nostr-bbs-forum-client/src/main.rs:40-52`; legacy ADR-090). Channel post
  counts are derived from the event set on demand, never accumulated (legacy
  ADR-091); deep-link entry self-bootstraps its own state (legacy ADR-092).
  Zone-first landing scopes navigation to the operator's `[[zones]]` config
  projected into `window.__ENV__.ZONE_CONFIG` (legacy ADR-107).
- **Retro BBS client** (`nostr-bbs-bbs-client`, served at `/community/bbs/`) — the
  M2 write-path is implemented via an in-client signer (`BbsSigner`) that adopts
  the forum session key when same-origin (`crates/nostr-bbs-bbs-client/src/app.rs:20-26`,
  `crates/nostr-bbs-bbs-client/src/signer.rs:64,224,250`). Mobile-first redesign
  (legacy ADR-108) is T1-shipped, T2/T3 in progress; the zone-bound one-shot PWA
  install (legacy ADR-109) shipped in release `1.0.0-beta.5`.

### Relay admission

The relay worker (`nostr-bbs-relay-worker`) gates events by trust level and kind.
Gift-wraps (kind 1059) are recipient-gated on the first `["p", <hex>]` tag rather
than the ephemeral author, and are accepted only if that recipient is a
whitelisted member (`crates/nostr-bbs-relay-worker/src/relay_do/nip_handlers.rs:103-110,510-516`).
Ban-gating covers user-authored content kinds explicitly; gift-wraps are excluded
from ban-gating because the recipient-whitelist gate already bounds them
(`nip_handlers.rs:58-64`).

## Known divergences & open items

- **Absorption incomplete.** Upstream `nostr` is a live dependency with NIP flags
  enabled and the canary is built, but zero `nostr-bbs-core` crypto modules have
  been deleted (`crates/nostr-bbs-core/src/`). Legacy ADR-076's *Proposed* status
  understates the in-flight dependency+canary work. The absorption is gated on the
  canary verdict (Shape A vs Shape C); until it lands, `nostr-bbs-core` remains the
  authority for on-`wasm32` Schnorr.
- **Kit version drift.** The published-version narrative in legacy ADR-103 and the
  `Cargo.toml` comment ("published to crates.io as 1.0.0-beta.3") is stale — the
  workspace is on `1.0.0-beta.9` (`crates/nostr-bbs-core/Cargo.toml:3`). Reconcile
  the published/registry version before the next release.
- **ADR-109 index/file disagreement.** `docs/adr/README.md:50` lists ADR-109 as
  "implementation pending" while the ADR file header states it shipped in
  `1.0.0-beta.5` (`docs/archive/adr/ADR-109-zone-bound-bbs-pwa-install.md:3`). The file is
  correct; the index is stale.
- **BBS write-path key custody.** Legacy ADR-105 §2.3 decided the BBS client would
  delegate signing to a forum `sign()` seam; the shipped code holds key material
  directly in `BbsSigner` (`crates/nostr-bbs-bbs-client/src/app.rs:25`,
  `signer.rs:64`). ADR-105 was amended (2026-07-03) to acknowledge this; the
  decision-as-originally-stated diverges from code.
- **CF-Workers pod federation degenerate.** ADR-086's pod fallback returns only
  data D1 already holds because ADR-087's portable-cores decision is unresolved.
- **Sprint-resident ADRs.** ADR-090/091/092 keep their canonical full text under
  `docs/sprint/2026-05-17-ux-audit/`; the `docs/adr/` stubs reserve the numbers.

## Invariants (must not silently change)

1. **`nostr-bbs-core` owns on-`wasm32` Schnorr** until the canary records Shape A
   and a module is deliberately deleted. Enabling the upstream `nostr` NIP flags
   does not, by itself, retire any hand-rolled module.
2. **`FORUM_BASE` is applied in exactly two places** (`<Router base=>`,
   `base_href()`). Adding a third re-introduces the double-prefix / deep-route-404
   class of bugs.
3. **Channel counts are derived, never accumulated** — a mutable counter drifts
   against deletions and replaceable events.
4. **ACL `.acl`/`.meta` sidecar access coerces to `Control`** — never widen it, or
   the read-disclosure / control-coercion holes reopen.
5. **Gift-wraps are recipient-whitelist-gated**, not author-gated; the ephemeral
   author must never be used for the admission decision.
6. **`solid-pod-rs` stays an exact (`=`) pin** — a caret range would let a resolve
   pull a newer published alpha.

## Change process

Any change to the crate topology, the absorption status, the pod tiers, ACL
coercion, or a kit version requires: (1) updating the affected section with the new
`file:line`; (2) confirming the touched invariant still holds; (3) bumping `version`
and re-recording `verified_commit` from `git rev-parse --short HEAD`; (4) recording
the decision as a new `docs/adr/` ledger entry (copy `docs/adr/TEMPLATE.md`) in the
same change and regenerating the index (`node scripts/adr-index-gen.js docs/adr`).
Legacy ADR prose is evidence, not authority — cite it, do not defer to it.

## Estate closeout qualification — 2026-09-04

The operative ADR-2001–2009 closeout extensions qualify release identity, canary execution, signer custody and cross-version ACL claims. Index validity is documentation evidence. Native tests and WASM compilation are separate from an executed deployed journey. Shared policy code does not certify equal resolver/cache behaviour across differing pod revisions. Governance relay OK precedes projection and downstream application; expose these as separate receipt stages and require durable reconciliation before complete-system acceptance.

See the [forum review](../../VisionFlow/docs/estate-review/forum-decisions.md) for scoped evidence and acceptance requirements. Historical verified commits and activation claims are not refreshed by this source review.

## Proposed durable governance receipts — ADR-2010

[ADR-2010](adr/ADR-2010-durable-governance-outcome-receipts.md) proposes distinct signed, relay-accepted, projection-committed, consumer-received and applied/rejected states. Current relay OK establishes acceptance only. The complete receipt contract remains proposed and inactive; adoption requires agreement with the authority consumer and mutation owner, plus failure/restart evidence. Historical ADR-106 supplies rationale, not proof of this contract.
