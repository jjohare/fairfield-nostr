# Identity, Keys & Trust — nostr-rust-forum

## Purpose

Single source of truth for the cryptographic identity chain: how keys are derived
and rotated, how device keys are provisioned and revoked, how agents are
provisioned, how DMs are delivered and admitted, and how relay trust levels are
promoted and demoted. Ground-truth order: **live code > audit facts > legacy ADR
prose**. Legacy ADRs (094–102, 104) are citable evidence, never authority. System
topology, pod mesh and clients live in the sibling doc `BASELINE-architecture.md`.

## Current State

### Two distinct key-derivation constructions

`nostr-bbs-core::keys` exposes **two different** derivations that must not be
conflated:

1. **`derive_from_prf(prf_output, salt)`** — HKDF-SHA256 from a WebAuthn PRF
   output, salt-separated per identity (`crates/nostr-bbs-core/src/keys.rs:196-205`).
   Used for passkey-backed keys.
2. **`derive_subkey(root, tag)`** — deterministic, purpose-scoped child secret from
   a root secret key, computed as a single raw **HMAC-SHA-256** keyed by the root's
   32 secret bytes with the tag as the message
   (`crates/nostr-bbs-core/src/keys.rs:251-256`; legacy ADR-094). This is *not*
   HKDF — there is no Extract/Expand step; it is the exact JS
   `crypto.createHmac('sha256', root).update(tag).digest()` construction. Same `(root, tag)` always yields the same child; distinct tags give
   domain separation (`agentbox-mirror-v1` vs `agentbox-agent-v1` vs a rotated
   `agentbox-mirror-v2`). This is the cross-stack contract that agentbox's
   JavaScript mirror-key derivation matches byte-for-byte (known-answer JS-parity
   test, `keys.rs:478-486`).

**A derived subkey is recoverable from the root** by anyone holding the root — it
provides *domain separation*, **not** compromise isolation (`keys.rs:240`). This
disclaimer is load-bearing for the device-key and rotation model below.

### Device keys — revocable, gated, default-off

Revocable device keys (legacy ADR-099) let a device onboard without the master
key. The whole feature is gated behind the Worker var `DEVICE_KEYS_ENABLED`, which
enables only on the **exact** string `"true"` (default off) — checked
independently in the auth worker (`crates/nostr-bbs-auth-worker/src/devices.rs:88-92`)
and the relay worker (`crates/nostr-bbs-relay-worker/src/relay_do/nip_handlers.rs:1626-1665`).

The `device_keys` row lives in the **relay worker's D1** (`RELAY_DB` binding), not
the auth worker's, and carries a `revoked INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0` flag
(`crates/nostr-bbs-auth-worker/src/devices.rs:81-110`). Revocation is a
`revoked = 1` write the relay honours at NIP-42 AUTH time (`devices.rs:7`). When
the feature is off, a known device→owner mapping is **ignored** and the author key
is used as-is (`nip_handlers.rs:531,3010`).

### Key lifecycle

Root rotation, subkey re-derivation and device revocation compose into one
lifecycle (legacy ADR-100), owned across `nostr-bbs-core` (`derive_subkey`), the
auth worker (device registry) and the relay worker (AUTH-time attribution).
Rotating a root re-derives every purpose-scoped subkey; because subkeys are
root-recoverable (above), rotation — not per-subkey secrecy — is the compromise
boundary.

### Agent identity provisioning

Agents are commonly **derived** keys (via `derive_subkey`), not freshly generated
ones (legacy ADR-097). Provisioning is consolidated across the auth worker's
governance API (`/api/governance/agents/register`) and the relay worker, which owns
the `whitelist` cohort table and the `agent_registry` table in the
`nostr-bbs-relay` D1.

### DM delivery & gift-wrap admission

DMs use NIP-17/NIP-59 gift-wrap. On the **send** side, multi-device delivery
(legacy ADR-101) fans a DM out to a recipient's registered device keys — this is
the explicitly **deferred phase-2** work of ADR-099 and is **not yet implemented**.
On the **admission** side (legacy ADR-104, implemented), the relay extracts the
gift-wrap (kind 1059) recipient from the first `["p", <hex>]` tag — the recipient,
not the ephemeral author — and accepts only if that recipient is a whitelisted
member (`crates/nostr-bbs-relay-worker/src/relay_do/nip_handlers.rs:103-110,510-516`).

### Onboarding & recovery

- **Recovery/device-onboarding sheet** (legacy ADR-095) — additive to the one-time
  `NsecBackup` card; does not replace it.
- **`/connect` magic-link onboarding** (legacy ADR-098) — adds a magic-link QR to
  the recovery sheet plus a route to consume it.

### Trust levels & inactivity demotion

Trust is a four-level ladder (TL0–TL3) (`crates/nostr-bbs-relay-worker/src/trust.rs`).
Demotion uses **hysteresis**: TL2 is demoted at 90 % of threshold combined with
~6-month inactivity; **TL3 is never auto-demoted** (`trust.rs:9-10,70-85`). The
inactivity-decay sweep is inherently time-driven, so it runs on the **scheduled
(cron) trigger** alongside the profile backfill sweep, not inline
(`crates/nostr-bbs-relay-worker/src/cron.rs:264-272`; legacy ADR-102). Reads tally
at EOSE to drive promotion; the cron sweep drives demotion.

## Known divergences & open items

- **Multi-device DM delivery not implemented.** Legacy ADR-101 is *Accepted* but
  its implementation is the deferred ADR-099 phase-2 work; the send path does not
  yet fan out to device keys. Gift-wrap admission (ADR-104) is unaffected.
- **Device keys default-off.** `DEVICE_KEYS_ENABLED` is off unless the Worker var is
  exactly `"true"`; with it off, device→owner mappings are ignored and revocation
  has no effect at AUTH — the entire ADR-099/100 device story is dormant in a
  default deployment.
- **Subkeys are not compromise-isolated.** `derive_subkey` gives domain separation
  only (`keys.rs:240`); a leaked root exposes every child. Any design that assumes a
  compromised subkey is contained is wrong — rotation of the root is the only
  boundary.
- **Anomaly O1 "unreachable" claim is stale.** The register's O1/R10 claim that
  `check_demotion` / `increment_posts_read` were unreachable is resolved: reads
  tally at EOSE and demotion runs from the cron sweep
  (`crates/nostr-bbs-relay-worker/src/cron.rs:264-272`). Kept here so a reader does
  not re-open a closed finding.
- **BBS client holds key material directly.** The retro client's `BbsSigner` parses
  and holds a `SecretKey` (zeroized on drop) rather than delegating to a forum
  `sign()` seam (`crates/nostr-bbs-bbs-client/src/signer.rs:64,209,224`) — see
  `BASELINE-architecture.md` for the ADR-105 §2.3 divergence.

## Invariants (must not silently change)

1. **`derive_subkey` is a byte-for-byte cross-stack contract** with agentbox's JS
   mirror derivation — the JS-parity known-answer vector (`keys.rs:478-486`) must
   keep passing; changing the HKDF construction silently forks every derived
   identity across both stacks.
2. **`derive_from_prf` and `derive_subkey` are distinct** and must never be
   substituted for one another — different inputs, different security properties.
3. **`DEVICE_KEYS_ENABLED` enables only on exact `"true"`** and is checked
   identically in both workers; any looser parse widens the auth surface.
4. **Gift-wrap admission keys on the recipient `p` tag**, never the ephemeral
   author (`nip_handlers.rs:103-110`).
5. **TL3 is never auto-demoted**; demotion stays time-driven on the cron trigger,
   never inline on the hot admission path.
6. **A derived subkey is root-recoverable** — this disclaimer must survive any
   refactor of the key model; removing it invites a false compromise-isolation
   assumption.

## Change process

Any change to a derivation construction, the device-key gate, the trust ladder, or
the gift-wrap admission rule requires: (1) updating the affected section with the
new `file:line`; (2) confirming the touched invariant still holds (and, for
`derive_subkey`, that the JS-parity vector still passes); (3) bumping `version` and
re-recording `verified_commit` from `git rev-parse --short HEAD`; (4) recording the
decision as a new `docs/adr/` ledger entry (copy `docs/adr/TEMPLATE.md`) in the same
change and regenerating the index (`node scripts/adr-index-gen.js docs/adr`). Legacy
ADR prose is evidence, not authority — cite it, do not defer to it.
